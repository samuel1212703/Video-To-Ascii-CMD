# Video-To-Ascii-CMD
Repository to create Ascii art in CMD based on video file.

## Description
Made to take any file format, and transform it into ascii art, displayed as a video in the cmd. 
If the cmd formatting is wrong, try zooming a little and remember to make cmd fullscreen.
I made my cmd fullscreen, and zoomed out one tic.
Written in **Python 3.9** for **Windows**.

## Video
A test of the script: https://youtu.be/1o3KdnBJ0p0. <br/>[![Video to Ascii Art Generator](http://img.youtube.com/vi/1o3KdnBJ0p0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o3KdnBJ0p0 "Video to Ascii Art Generator")

## Usage (Windows)
The included .avi file is an example you are free to use. 

To run the script on a custom video use command ```python main.py path/videoExample.mp4 60 2.5```

Example of execution of the script on the example video (as seen in video):  ```python main.py 0001-0075.avi 60 2.5```
